#If there is 0 in n, then corresponding digit in x can be 0 or 1 and thus simulates addition is equivalent to xor...
#If there is 1 in n, then corresponding digit in x can only be zero to avoid carry and maitaining addition is equivalent to xor...
#Therefore, we just need to calculate number of zeroes in n and take 2**(number of zeroes)...
